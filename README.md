# API_Example

This is an example API for computing player bowling scores as requested for a job interview.  It turns out the rules to calculate bowling scores are not entirely straightforward!  Learn more [here](http://slocums.homestead.com/gamescore.html).  The server runs in Node.js/Express.js - use `npm install` to download dependencies and `npm test` to start the server.

A complete RESTful test procedure (using Mocha and Chai) is also included, and can be run using the `npm test` command.
